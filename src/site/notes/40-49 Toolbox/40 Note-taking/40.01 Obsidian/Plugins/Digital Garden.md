## Overview

## Usage

### Publishing

It configures to a GitHub repo that pushes updates directly to this repo from within Obsidian using the plugin. The updates could be adding, updating, or removing a note. It also could update in the global settings.

If you have a website domain, it could generate links, sitemap for better SSO, and RSS feeds.

### Settings
#### Note Global Settings

Settings presented in the plugin settings are global and applied instantly. But it is possible to set specific settings for a note using front matter.

#### Let All Frontmatter through

#### Note Specific Settings

#### Title

Frontmatter: `title: "My Custom Title"`

Add a custom page title instead of the name of your note. This allows you to use characters that are not allowed to use in filenames. (Ex: ":", "/", "|")

#### Custom Links

Frontmatter: `dg-permalink: "mynote"`

Set a custom URL for the note, disregarding its file structure. 

The permalinks can be an arbitrary level of folders deep, such as: `dg-permalink: "category/2022/mynote/"`

Setting metatags for a note can be done by adding a dg-metatags attribute like so:

```
dg-metatags:
 description: "some description"
 "og:image": "https://example.com/someimage.png"
```

Note that there is a single space before the "description" field, **not** a tab.

This feature can be used if you want custom titles and images when sharing links in social media. Using the example below will add a title and an image that will be used when sharing the link in social media.

```
dg-metatags:
 "og:title": "Title Appearing on Social Media Site"
 "og:image": "https://example.com/someimage.png"
```

#### Body Classes

Frontmatter: `dg-content-classes: cards`

Allows to customize each note with specific class.

It is possible to change the frontmatter key. For example, from `dg-content-classes` to `cssClasses`

#### Note Icons

Frontmatter: `dg-show-tags`

When turned on, tags in your frontmatter will be displayed on each note. If search is enabled, clicking on a tag will bring up a search for all notes containing that tag.

Each note can have an associated note icon. By default, this is set by the  
`dg-note-icon` property, but this can be changed in the [note icon settings](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/getting-started/04-appearance-settings/#note-icon-settings).  
By default, the plugin provides 4 options: `default`, `1`, `2`, and `3`.

The provided icons look like this:
default: ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oleeskild/digitalgarden/3d0155d9923c36f3637f87bf45b7142c6162e608/src/site/img/default-note-icon.svg)
1: <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oleeskild/digitalgarden/3d0155d9923c36f3637f87bf45b7142c6162e608/src/site/img/tree-1.svg"  width="35" height="35">
2: <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oleeskild/digitalgarden/3d0155d9923c36f3637f87bf45b7142c6162e608/src/site/img/tree-2.svg"  width="35" height="35">
3: <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oleeskild/digitalgarden/3d0155d9923c36f3637f87bf45b7142c6162e608/src/site/img/tree-3.svg"  width="35" height="35">

##### Changing and Adding Icons

You can change and add your own icons the following way:

The ideal way to change the default icons is by adding the svgs in the img folder and setting the appropriate css vars in body in a [custom css file](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/advanced/adding-custom-components/#dynamic-css-scss):

```css
body {
  --note-icon-1: url(/img/your-custom.svg);
  --note-icon-2: url(/img/tree-2.svg);
  --note-icon-3: url(/img/tree-3.svg);
  --note-icon-fallback: url(/img/default-note-icon.svg);}
}
```

To add new icons, let's say, for 'stone', add a snippet like this (and add the relevant svg) in a [custom css file](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/advanced/adding-custom-components/#dynamic-css-scss):

```css
body.title-note-icon .cm-s-obsidian > header > h1[data-note-icon="stone"]::before,
body.filetree-note-icon .filename[data-note-icon="stone"]::before,
body.links-note-icon .internal-link[data-note-icon="stone"]::before,
body.backlinks-note-icon .backlink[data-note-icon="3"]::before {
  background-image: url(/img/stone.svg);
}
```

### Advanced

#### Path Rewrite

Define rules for rewriting the folder structure on the website.

For example, if the path of a note locally is "Obsidian/local/note.md", it could be changed to "online/note.md". This could be achieved by writing the rule as `Obsidian/local:online`.

It also supports live preview of the rule, so you can test a path and check how the path will be with rules applies

#### Custom Filters

If you want any of your content to be modified before publishing the note, you can add a filter. For example, hide text that is inside a specific pattern.

It also supports Regex groups, meaning you can use $1, $2 etc. in the replacement string to insert the first and second regex group and so on.

### Updating the Website

If the main repo got new features or updates, the plugin can pull request this new updates directly on the configured repo.
