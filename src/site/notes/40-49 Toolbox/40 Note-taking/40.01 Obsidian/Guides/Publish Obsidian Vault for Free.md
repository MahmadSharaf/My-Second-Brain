# How I Published My Knowledge Base Online for Free

Publishing a blog online consists on three main points:
1. Writing the content
2. Build the website
3. Hosting it online

## Writing the Content

Since I prefer writing my notes in Markdown syntax, I use [[40-49 Toolbox/40 Note-taking/40.01 Obsidian/+ Obsidian\|Obsidian]] as my knowledge base writing tool. It is an offline tool that is available for most of the OSes, which makes it convenient to be used by all of my devices.

## Building the Website

I am not into building websites. Especially, that my needs are simple.

Moving into that direction, I decided to look for open-source, ready-made, and have most of Obsidian's features like Interactive Graph, Backlinks, and Page previews.

Obsidian's popularity made the search an easy task, and I found many and [[40-49 Toolbox/40 Note-taking/40.01 Obsidian/Guides/Free Obsidian-like website\|reviewed]] the most interesting ones. But I decided to proceed with [[40-49 Toolbox/40 Note-taking/40.01 Obsidian/Plugins/Digital Garden\|Digital Garden]].

The steps to configure the plugin are explained [[40-49 Toolbox/40 Note-taking/40.01 Obsidian/Plugins/Digital Garden#Configure the Plugin\|here]].

## Hosting it Online

Since my objective is to host for free, and my knowledge base is a static site, then I looked into three options, Netlify, GitHub pages, and Cloudflare Pages. I proceeded with Cloudflare pages for convenience, stability, and free security.

I have a [[10-19 Technical Skills/10 Web Development/10.01 Hosting/Cloudflare Pages\|step-by-step]] guide here that elaborates on:
