# GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages provides the option to host one of GitHub repo as a static site. The steps are easy and elaborated on [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site).

By default, the website will be hosted on `<github-username>.github.io`. But I have a custom domain, www.sharaf.cc, and luckily GitHub Pages provides the option to configure a custom domain, which is elaborated on [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/about-custom-domains-and-github-pages).
