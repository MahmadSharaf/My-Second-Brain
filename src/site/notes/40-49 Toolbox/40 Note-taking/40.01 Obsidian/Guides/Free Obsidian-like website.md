### My Review

- It is the most flexible, full featured solution I tried so far. I have not done extensive use yet, but so far so good.

### Caveats

- Each change has its own commit, so each change will have its own Build. For example, if you updated 10 notes, you will have 10 new commits and 10 builds. This could be an issue when you host your website on a tier will limited number of builds per month.
