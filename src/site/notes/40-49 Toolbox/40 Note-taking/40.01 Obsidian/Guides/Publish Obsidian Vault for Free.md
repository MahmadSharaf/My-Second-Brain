# How I Published My Knowledge Base Online for Free

Publishing a blog online consists on three main points:
1. Writing the content
2. Build the website
3. Hosting it online

## Writing the Content

Since I prefer writing my notes in Markdown syntax, I use [[40-49 Toolbox/40 Note-taking/40.01 Obsidian/+ Obsidian\|Obsidian]] as my knowledge base writing tool. It is an offline tool that is available for most of the OSes, which makes it convenient to be used by all of my devices.

## Building the Website

I am not into building websites. Especially, that my needs are simple.

Moving into that direction, I decided to look for open-source, ready-made, and have most of Obsidian's features like Interactive Graph, Backlinks, and Page previews.

Obsidian's popularity made the search an easy task, and I found many and [[40-49 Toolbox/40 Note-taking/40.01 Obsidian/Guides/Free Obsidian-like website\|reviewed]] the most interesting ones. But I decided to proceed with Digital Garden.

## Overview

**Publish your notes to the web, for free. In your own personal garden.**

The [Obsidian Digital Garden Plugin](https://github.com/oleeskild/obsidian-digital-garden) is a free and open source publishing tool for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md).

Publish your notes directly from [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to the internet. While [feature packed](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/features/), it is [highly configurable](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/getting-started/03-note-settings/) and [hackable](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/advanced/adding-custom-components/). Enable and disable features on a per-note basis. Use it as a full-fledged digital garden or as a [simple note sharing solution](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/example-pages/simple-page/).

### My Review

- It is the most flexible, full featured solution I tried so far. I have not done extensive use yet, but so far so good.

### Caveats

- Each change has its own commit, so each change will have its own Build. For example, if you updated 10 notes, you will have 10 new commits and 10 builds. This could be an issue when you host your website on a tier will limited number of builds per month.

## Hosting it Online

Since my objective is to host for free, and my knowledge base is a static site, then I looked into three options, Netlify, GitHub pages, and Cloudflare Pages. I proceeded with Cloudflare pages for convenience, stability, and free security.

I have a [[10-19 Technical Skills/10 Web Development/10.01 Hosting/Cloudflare Pages\|step-by-step]] guide here that elaborates on:
- How to connect your GitHub repo to Cloudflare
- Configure the Build Settings
