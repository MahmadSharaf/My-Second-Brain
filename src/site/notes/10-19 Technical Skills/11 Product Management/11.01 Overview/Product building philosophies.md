# Product Building Philosophies

## Product-Driven

- Focus on solving problems for users.

- The engineers build based on these requirements
- Pros:
	- Customer centric approach
	- Build what customer want
- Cons:
	- Lack empathy from non-customer-facing teams
- Example:
	- Amazon same day shipping

## Engineering-Driven

- Focus on solving technical problems.
- Engineers build things and then hand them off to the PM.
- The PM role is to figure out the technology and bring it to the market.
- Pros:
	- Promotes technical innovation
	- Sometimes the customer doesn't know what they want.
- Cons:
	- Increases possibility that product won't resonate with the customer
- Example:
	- Google Glass

## Hybrid-Driven

	- Sometimes the customer doesn't know what they want.
- Cons:
	- Increases possibility that product won't resonate with the customer
